# CarSurvey
Users will scan a QR code and which then opens a survey where users can document their experience as a passenger in transportation. Using Supabase for the backend data storage, averaged metrics will be shown to users after completion, as well as comments left by previous users. 

Potentially will generate unique QR codes upon each use. Could be developed into an app.
